def _pdist(a, b):
    """Compute pair-wise squared distance between points in `a` and `b`.
    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        An NxM matrix of N samples of dimensionality M.
    b : array_like
        An LxM matrix of L samples of dimensionality M.
    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        Returns a matrix of size len(a), len(b) such that eleement (i, j)
        contains the squared distance between `a[i]` and `b[j]`.
